### Table fo contents

1.Binomial Distribution

2.Gaussian Distrbution

3.General Distribution


### Purpose of python project

The purpose of this project is to create a python module that calculates Binomial and Gaussian Distribution

### Contents of each Python script

1. Binomial Distribution.py : The Binomial Distribution class calculates and visualises a Binomial Distribution

Attribues : 

            mean - representing the mean value of the distribution

            stdev - representing the standard deviation of the distribution
            
            data_list - a list of floats to be extracted from the data file
            
            p - representing the probability of an event occurring
            
            n - number of trials
            
 2. Gaussian Distribution.py : The Gaussian distribution class calculates and visualises a Gaussian Distribution
 
  Attributes:
       
             mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
        
             stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
       
             data_list (list of floats) a list of floats extracted from the data file
             
            
  3. General Distribution.py : The Gaussian Distribution class is the parent class for the two classes listed above and the        other classes inherits the attributes of the parent class
  
     Attributes:  
            
            mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
            
            stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
            
            data_list (list of floats) a list of floats extracted from the data file
